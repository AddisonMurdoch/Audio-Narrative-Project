Summary
In my Audio narrative, I chose to write about the infamous women's athlete Caitlin Clark. Not only are here records and basketball stats speaking for itself, she has been an inspiration for all athletes in the world. Many people continue to discuss what makes her so special, and I want to mainly touch on what most people don't say about her. On and off the court, this legendary player and person highlights how important sports are to society, and Caitlin Clark is seen as a role model to everyone, whether a basketball fan or not. Using some of her article appearances along with interviews, I will reach the intended audience, and ultimately set a precedent for what this athlete has done and will continue to do for women in sports.
