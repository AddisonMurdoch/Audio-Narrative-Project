Summary
In my Audio narrative, I chose to write about the infamous women's athlete Caitlin Clark. Not only are here records and basketball stats speaking for itself, she has been an inspiration for all athletes in the world. Many people continue to discuss what makes her so special, and I want to mainly touch on what most people don't say about her. On and off the court, this legendary player and person highlights how important sports are to society, and Caitlin Clark is seen as a role model to everyone, whether a basketball fan or not. Using some of her article appearances along with interviews, I will reach the intended audience, and ultimately set a precedent for what this athlete has done and will continue to do for women in sports.

I used this source to incorporate a lot about Caitlin Clark’s childhood and hometown life. A lot of what makes her so special roots from what she was brought into from her family, friends, town, and the sport of basketball. Taking a lot of information from this piece, I included some more detail into her life as an evolving super star on and off the court. 

Source 2) The Caitlin Clark Effect: Illuminating Women’s Sports History

For this source, I focused more on Caitlin’s current and very present impact on women’s sports and sport history as an athlete at the professional level now. Coming from Iowa and now in the WNBA, I added some information about how she inspires people as a growing phenomenon, and how people view her as she continues to be in the spotlight.
